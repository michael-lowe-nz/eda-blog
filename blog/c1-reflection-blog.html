        My take on the DBC/EDA experience is that it will be such a unique experience filled with so many different aspects. It is like nothing I've ever done before. Although I know it will present some real challenges and a lot of frustration at times, I think by the end I will look back and think wow, doing EDA might have been the best decision I have ever made. I like how we are encouraged not just to develop our technical abilities, but also our personal skills and I feel as if the whole thing has a good holisitic feel to it.

        Looking forward to lots of interaction with my cohort, will love seeing some good banter on the slack channel! Awesome thing is about how we aren't just relying on tutors for help, we are relying on each other, all knowledge is shared and help is never too far away.
        Looking forward to the journey ahead!
