           I find myself quite aware of being empathetic since starting to read "Searc Inside Yourself". I find asking myself questions like 'what is this person thinking?', 'why is this person acting in this way', really helps and has made me act more kindly in some situations.
         </p>
         <p>
           I found the little poem in chapter 7 "Just Like Me" to be quite inciteful, and I do think of a form of this sometimes when interacting with people. Its worth thinking whenever someone annoys you that they aren't acting specifically to annoy you, and that they want to be happy just like you do.
         </p>

           “This person has a body and a mind, just like me. This person has feelings, emotions, and thoughts, just like me. This person has, at some point in his or her life, been sad, disappointed, angry, hurt, or confused, just like me.”
         </p>
         <p>
           Sometimes I think that other people could learn to be a lot more empathetic. Sometimes when I hear people complaining about something, or getting pissed off at someone, you realise that they be more empathetic with the other party and realise where the conflict is coming from. If someone says something that offends someone else, it is a useful thought to have that the person was not intending to offend, and at the end of the day is a good person with good intentions.
