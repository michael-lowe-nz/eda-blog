                <h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
                <p>
                    When I am programming, I usually feel like I'm in control, like I have this awesome kind of power in my fingers, to bend the computer's processing power towards my needs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But then as soon as you think you're doing well, something stops working, something you wrote that you thought would do one thing starts to do another. Where did I go wrong? Am I stupid? Is the computer stupid? It's the language's fault. It's slackbot's
                    fault!
                </p>
                <p>
                    One thing that triggers me towards an emotional response when programming, is when I make small syntactical errors, and I don't find them that fast even though they are so simple.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's usually something that I would usually think that the very helpful colours in Atom would help me solve, but my brain just doesn't register.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is when the emotional responses start, and I think I should be good enough not to have such a silly mistake in the first place. But I feel like I am quick to realise that I am better off for having made that mistake.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I like to think of the Michael Jordan quote that 'Search Inside Yourself' gives us:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <quote><i>I've missed more than 9000 shots in my career. I've lost almost 300 games. 26 times, I've been trusted to take the game winning shot and missed. I've failed over and over and over again in my life. And that is why I succeed.</i></quote>
                </p>
                <p>
                  Seems a bit deep for programming sometimes, but its still a nice thought to mellow the frustration as we become web developers in 18 weeks at EDA!
                </p>
                <h5>Siberian North Rail Road</h5>
                <p>
                  I like the imagery associated with the Siberian North Rail Road. It is like <b>Chill out man!</b>, and I don't generally consider myself someone who would act out emotionally, or say something flippantly that I would regret. However the Siberian North Rail Road technique is still good for keeping my emotions in check, and not having festering thoughts.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Having read most of the book now, I do find that I am trying to be more empathetic. I often in my interactions with people think about what they are feeling, and this is a great thought that I think already demonstrates a greater awareness of empathy.
