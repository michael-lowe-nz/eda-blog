      <h3>Emotional Intelligence</h3>
      <section id="Emotional Intelligence">
        <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>
        <p>
          I think its a nice thought that emotional intelligence is learned. We may think sometimes that people are naturally more talented than us, but every body can improve their emotional intelligence.
        </p>
        <p>
          It is easy to see how emotional intelligene can help us, not only in our journey to becoming awesome developers, but also to becoming better all round people that can relate well to other people. I'm keen to read the rest of the book. 
        </p>
        <h4>How did you find the 2 minutes of mindfulness?</h4>
        <p>
          I found the 2 minutes quite relaxing. The book talks a lot about how the mind's focus can be trained like a muscle. The instruction is to focus on your breathing, and when your mind starts to wander, gently bring it back to focus. I can feel this happening over and over again, and it does feel like I'm working out my brain. This focus training also reminds you of the wonders that go on inside your mind and that it is capable of a lot of amazing things.
