      <h3>Time and Habits</h3>
      <p>
        Good produtivity and habits probably don't come naturally to me. I think I am doing ok at the moment though becuase everything is new and exciting, so motivation is high. I know I can't rely on this being high all the time so need to observe some of the techniques from the readings. I like the idea of timeboxing, setting how long you are going to spend on this task before you do it has really helped keep me on track. I liked what I read finding the goldilocks zone with flow, where you have to break problems down into smaller problems that are the right level of difficulty to help you get into a flow. I want to try this going forward.
        :)
