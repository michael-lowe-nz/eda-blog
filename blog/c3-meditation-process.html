         <h5>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
         <p>
           I really struggled to resist the urge to change things from my wireframes mid way through coding it into the HTML and styling it, either to make it easier because I couldn't figure out how to make it do what I was wanting it to do, or because I thought it would make it look better.
         </p>
         <p>
           I kept the 'process over product' mantra in my mind and resisted the urge to not follow my wireframes. I am glad in the end though because there is a little bit of satisfaction with being able to get from something I have drawn with a pen, to what is a functional webpage.
         </p>
         <h5>Search Inside Yourself, Chapter 2: Breathing as if you're life depends on it</h4>
         <p>
           Before reading this chapter, I was under the impression that meditation was just about training the attention. But after I read this chapter, I've realised that this isn't the whole purpose of doing meditation. It talks about how training the attention is like having a big flash light, as only when you use it to look for something in a dark room is it actually any use to you. This shows how the real purpose of meditating is to be able to 'search inside yourself' and view insights into your own mind that you can't usually detect.
         </p>
         <p>
           I have already been doing a few of the <a href="https://www.heaspace.com">heaspace.com</a> meditation sessions, so I have had a few really satisfying sessions where my mind has constantly wandered off when I'm focusing on breathing, and I don't realise for a while and then I gently pull my focus back to breathing. In later sessions, my attention has wandered off less so I am getting a good indication that my mind is getting a mental 'workout' of sorts. I am still yet to see how this will translate to the rest of my life.
