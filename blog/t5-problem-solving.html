         <h5>A time I got blocked on a simple problem...</h5>
         <p>
           There are times when you figure out what you've done wrong, and you think how did I do that? And how did it take me so long to find such a simple syntactial error?
         </p>
         <p>
           There was an instance when I was trying to loop through all the dots in the dot game, and add them to the correct counter depending on their class. Turns I didn't get the array put in my variable becasuse I put the class name as <code>getElementsByClassName."dots"</code> instead of putting it in brackets
         </p>
         <h5>A time I solved a problem in an elegant way...</h5>
         <p>
           Trying to loop through an array, and change some counts, but some <code>console.log()</code> statements showed me that, this program was only doing my loop once! And not the desired <code>array.length</code> amount of times!!
         </p>
         <p>
           A bit of snooping around with the developer tools in chrome showed me that I had used the 'i' from my outer loop instead of the 'j' for my inner loop somewhere within the parameters of my for loop! Whoops! Such easy mistakes, but felt proud to find the faults with the developer tools.
         </p>
         <p>
         </p>
         <h5>Problem Solving Techniques and Processes</h5>
         <p>
           <b>Pseudocode</b> is not something I use much, although I do sometimes talk to myself about what I'm going to try and do with the problem.<br>
           <b>Trying something</b> is my best method I feel, once there is something down in the script, the problem is infinitely more solvable, plus I'm usually at least halfway there!<br>
           <b>Rubber Ducky Method</b> is good, I'm usually just talking things out loud though and not following a specific protocol.<br>
           <b>Reading error messages</b> is essential. With more practice, I'm starting to have a better idea of what they mean everytime.<br>
           <code><b>Console.log()</b></code>'ing is my favourite method. Forces you to think about things a bit more, and a good way to investigate your program.<br>
           <b>Google</b> is all about finding the person that had the same problem as you. Once you've found it its great, but finding it is the hard part.<br>
         </p>
         <p>
           Every time I debug something, I really feel like its a great learning experience. So always go forward knowing I've learned how to tackle one more problem.
         </p>
         <h5>Some Array Functions</h5>
         <p>
           <code>.map()</code> goes and does something of your chooosing, to every item in your array.
         </p>
         <p>
           <code>.filter()</code> adds everything to a new array, provided that the item passes a given test. The test could be something like "are you bigger than 42?".
         </p>
         <p>
           <code>.reduce()</code> whittles your array down to one value, doing something with all the items all the way. For example it could be adding them, and you would end up with the sum of the array reduced from the whole array.
