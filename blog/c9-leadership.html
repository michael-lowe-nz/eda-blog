         <p>
           There was once a girl that came in for a trial at the cafe, and she accidentally wrote down a kitchen order wrong. So the meal came out wrong, and the chef/owner came out the front and really had a go at her. She goes off crying into the store room and says to me "you've got to nip that sort of behaviour in the bud". The girl was very upset, and even though I managed to cheer her up a bit and was able to get her to carry on the rest of the day, but she didn't come back, even though she was the best of the trial people that we had.
         </p>

           This incident comes to mind when I think of incompasssionate leadership, I think its because it really stresses the importance of people working together in a positive way, and how there are people out there who genuinely think aggressive 'shouty' approaches are the way to get the most out of their workers.

           The meditating goodness exercise is a nice feeling. To be honest I've slacked off in my meditation and my minfulness in the latter weeks of phase-0, but hoping that bootcamp will kickstart a new enthusiasm for it all with yoga and engineering empathy stuff etc..

         <p>Tonglen was also quite good, I do really enjoy these exercises. I should just remember to do them more often. I don't think the SCARF model has applied to me that much personally during phase-0. The one I think is the most relavent is autonomy. I really have quite a strong urge to be able to be in complete control over the browser, with all the HTML,CSS and Javascript. I think this is good, I would really love to make pages behave in the exact way that I intend for them to with css, but this isn't always the case. This is a really motivating factor for me in learning to code!</p>
