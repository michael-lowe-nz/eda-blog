         <p>A responive site is one that will change itself for different screen sizes. It is one single site that can adapt to any device that the user may be using. I would encourage you next time you are looking at a site on a computer, to drag and resize the browser, and see the magic that happens!</p>
         <p>Mobile first design is where websites are designed first with mobile in mind. We start off designing a small site that could fit on a mobile phone, and we start with that and go up in screen sizes. We add features to the intial 'mobile first design' to make it suitable for desktops, rather than the other way round. If we started with a desktop site, and tried to strip away features as we went down in screen size then it would be much more difficult.

         <p><b>Frameworks</b> are a list of rules on which you can build a site. Its like building a house, so many houses are built that it saves lots of time if you can borrow some very fundamental common features from previously built houes. This is what front end frameworks are like. They set out page up into an easy to use column and row grid, where they have set all the widths and heights to make it look nice.

           A <b>wireframe</b> is a way in which we can plan our websites. As the name suggests, we draw a wire frame, a mockup of site free of colours, content, images or anything. It is just the bare bones of the site, from this we can see which boxes need to be created and where, and it gives a good starting point to get stuck in and start coding the site.

         <h6><b>Hardest features of wireframe to implement</b></h6>
         <p>I found the navbar really hard to implement. I find it very confusing working with unordered lists and their nesting. It is hard to know which level of the element to target for which purpose. I always seem to be trialing and erroring putting inline block in all types of selectors to get my buttons to go on the side of each other rather than on top of each other. I also wasn't too sure where the skeleton framework fit in with it. Am I meant to make it a row and float the different parts left and right? Or do I make it multiple columns with some of the columns being empty placeholders? </p>
         <p>The other thing I struggled with in implementing my wireframes was the footer. It is annoying when there isn't enough content on the page and the footer will detach from the bottom. A quick google search reveals that this is an age old problem though with multiple fixes, though these are scaring me a bit currently so have just chosen to leave it for the time being until I am more knowledgeable/skillful with my CSS wizardry.
