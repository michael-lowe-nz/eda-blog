                <h3 class="blog-header">JavaScript Basics</h3>
                <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                <p>
                    HTML and CSS make up the content and style of a webpage, but they are not 'programming' languages. JavaScript on the other end is a high level programming language which means that it has a lot more powerful capablility. We can tell it to ask the user for something, and then react based on what the user says. It is fully dynamic in a way that HTML and CSS are not. The possiblities with javascript are endless!
                </p>
                <h4> Control Flow and Loops</h4>
                <p>
                  Imagine you are deciding what to eat. You have to decide how hungry you are, if you aren't very hungry you might just have a snack. If you are hungry, you might have a light meal. If you are very hungry, you might have some chips, a steak, some potato salad and some dessert.
                </p>
                <p>
                  This is how javascript works in terms of flow, we have a variable 'hunger', and we choose an outcome depending on what that variable is.
                </p>
                <p>
                  A loop might work like heating up soup. We stir the pot on the stove, and then test to see if it is hot enough. We will continue to do this until the soup is hot, and then we can stop the loop, turn the stove off, and eat our soup!
                </p>
                <h4>Accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
                <p>
                  An array is a collection of things, that aren't necessarily related. They can be a bunch of different types. Think of it like a toolbox, there's a whole bunch of tools in the tool box, but they aren't all the same tool. There are hammers, nails, screwdrivers and a lot of other tools! But even though they are different, they can all fit nicely in the tool box.
                </p>
