        <h4>Wish List</h4>
        <p>
          I really like simple sites that are clean and functional. One of the sites that I liked from the CSS zen garden was this <a href="http://www.csszengarden.com/221/" class="link">Mid Century Modern</a> design. I like the big clean shapes and the vibrant contrasting colours.
        </p>
        <p>
          From <a href="http://www.bnz.co.nz/" class="link">BNZ</a> I like the way that transparent HTML buttons are overlaid on top of images with transparency so you can see what is going on underneath. I think this is a cool clean look.
        </p>
        <p>
          I like the sort of gridded portfolio of <a href="http://designworks.com/" class="link">Design Works</a> where each project is on a card that changes on the mouse over. Would like to use this sort of style for my blog entries.

        <h4>An Analogy</h4>
        <p>
          An analogy for HTML, CSS and DOM could be a book. The HTML would be the content of the book, the actual story. It drives the narrative of the webpage like the words in the book.
        </p>
        <p>
          CSS is what the book actually looks like. The margins in the page, the front cover, how big the words are.
        </p>
        <p>
          The DOM is the Document Object Model. In terms of the book analogy, it is the actual physical copy of the book, the one that exists in the real world and the one that we as 'readers' are ultimately interacting with.

      <section id="boxifying">
        <h4>Boxifying</h4>
        <p>
          Boxifying a design is where you separate all the components of a design into separate and distinct boxes. Boxes can contain other boxes, and there may be boxes inside of boxes inside of boxes!
        </p>
        <p>
          The tree hierarchical structure of an HTML webpage lends itself to the box model, where all the different elements can be thought of as boxes.
          This helps in turning a design mockup into real HTML!
