         <p>
           The question we are sort of asking ourselves, is how is it best to have sustained happiness in our lives? It starts from 3 things. Pleasure, passion and higher purpose.

           I think for me, my motivation to program comes from the thought that I will soon be able to create things. Creating web apps, webpages and all sorts of different things. From being able to build stuff, I think there is always a capacity to make a higher order difference to the world. I always kind of envisioned myself finding a good balance between doing what I love, and actually making the world a slightly better place because of it.

           All of this reminds me of a TED talk I saw a while back from the founder of Uber. He was talking about how Uber as a company has a really good big picture. He talked about how the end goal of Uber is to take the majority of the cars in the world off the road by ride sharing. With what Uber does, they actually have the ability to effectively reduce the earth's carbon emissions by a huge amount. This is inspiring to me that a tech company can have such masssive impact on the environment.
