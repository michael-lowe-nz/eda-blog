         <h5>What is the Relationship between Mindfulness and Awareness?</h5>
         <p>
           The difference is in how we observe both mindfulness and awareness. When we meditate, we are being mindful, we are being mindful that our brains are complex and have many thoughts, that sometimes we forget to think about the existence of it all. Mindfulness is like stepping back, and like <a href="https//:headspae.com">headspace.com</a> says, watch the cars go by without chasing them.
         </p>
         <p>
           Awareness is when we realise that in response to different life situtations, we have emotions. It is the acknowledgement that we are not our emotions. Our emotions are an extension of us, they are like monsters. The monsters shouldn't be fed!
         </p>
         <p>
           Chapter 4 of search inside yourself focuses a lot on realising that you are angry, or realising that you are sad, or mad or angry. But that we should not let these emotions rule our actions. We should take breaths, embrace the emotion, feel what it is doing to you and your mind. But then let it go, and not ake decisions in the heat of the moment.
         </p>
         <h5> Body Scan</h5>
         <p>
           I tried the body scan technique. It is a good way to assess how you are feeling, and in a very mindful way. I've got a sore knee at the moment from this basketball injury. When I bodyscan, I think I have a better attitude towards the pain.
         </p>
         <p>
           In the chapter there was an example of someone who had got rid of a strong anxiety disorder, just by being mindful about the feelings associated. This sounded quite extreme, but it is kind of inspiring in a way.
         </p>
         <h5> What Did I Take Away?</h5>
         <p>
           I think I took away some good lessons about emotions. I don't really consider my self to be really rash, or ever ruled by my emotions too much, but from this chapter I think I can empathise with others who do, or at least be aware that people's emotions don't make them who they are. All fairly airy fairy stuff, but gives us an insight into things that we never give much thought.
